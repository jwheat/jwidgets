                            <p>Yes, as a Christian college, Messiah communicates behavior expectations for students that focus on our relationship with God and each other, and the practical implications of community life. Before coming to Messiah, students are asked to review these expectations and agree to live by them if they choose to join the Messiah community. You can learn more about Messiah's community standards in our  <a href="https://www.messiah.edu/download/downloads/id/528/Current_Student_Handbook.pdf">student handbook</a> to see if Messiah College is a good fit for your values and the way of life you want during your college experience. </p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="sl-answer">
                            <p>On a limited basis, first-year students can have a car on campus if they are at least 21 years of age, live more than 250 miles from campus or hold an off-campus job. After the first year, any student may have a car on campus.The College also has Zipcar, a car-sharing service that allows students to rent the cars for off-campus fun. Students often share rides home and off campus—a great way to make new friends as a new student!</p>

                            <p>All single, full-time students under the age of 23 are required to live on campus.
