                    <p>College is more than just going to class and studying. You’ll receive an outstanding education during your time at Messiah--but you’ll also experience fun, excitement and make lifelong friendships. As an undergraduate residential or <a href="https://www.messiah.edu/commuters">commuter student</a>, you’ll realize Messiah’s campus is buzzing with activity and that there’s always something to do. In fact, many of these experiences become meaningful traditions for our students and make Messiah a really hard place to leave when you graduate.</p>
