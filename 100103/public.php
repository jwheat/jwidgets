            <p>Messiah’s goal is to bring together students from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds who reflect the variety and richness within God’s kingdom. We continually learn from each other—through both our similarities and differences—which promotes an important intercultural educational experience. Multicultural and international students are an integral part of Messiah’s community and campus life.</p>
